#Concert Clue
###http://www.concertclue.com

##This was a collaborative project implemented by Chad Latham, Matt Stuhring, and Patrick Richardson. We utilized issue tracking, pair programming, and agile development practices to coordinate and implement the site.

##What problem does Concert Clue solve?
Concert Clue addresses the problem that keeping track of many different artists and their shows in your area can be difficult and time consuming.

##Who has this problem?
People who are concert goers and music fans. The targeted demographic is young and enthusiastic college students.

##How does your project solve this problem?
Concert Clue lets you know when your favorite artists have a show in your city. When an artist on your list has an upcoming show; the showtime, location, and their website will pop up in your feed.  Finally you can check one place and never miss a concert.

##What web APIs did it use?
Concert Clue is powered by the Bands in Town API http://www.bandsintown.com/api/overview which is a free, open, and well maintained API. Bands in Town also offers the possibility to link to ticket sales and credit a referring site a portion of ticket sales.

##What technologies did it use?
The site uses a Node.js Express server, jQuery, Google's Materialize Framework, Knex.js, Joi.js, PostgreSQL, request-promise, and bcrypt-as-promised.

##What was the most valuable piece of Customer feedback you received?
Working on a team is an invaluable experience as it provides different perspectives to the development process and a better final product that incorporates those perspectives. Keeping each team member supplied with a clearly defined list of projects to complete where those mini projects fit together in a cohesive whole is a critical portion of team work.

##What was the biggest challenge?
The biggest challenge we faced was correctly identifying which routes the server would need to accommodate each feature of the site and connecting the client to those routes in an efficient manner.
